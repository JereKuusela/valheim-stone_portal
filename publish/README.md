# Stone Portal

Enables the stone portal from the game files.

Install on all clients and on the server (modding [guide](https://youtu.be/L9ljm2eKLrk)).

If not installed on the server, the configuration is not synced.

If not installed on a client, being near the portal prints errors to the console.

# Configuration

- Enabled: If disabled, the portal can't be crafted without cheats.
- Ignore restrictions: If enabled, all items can be teleported.
- Recipe: Required items. Format is `id:amount,id:amount,...`
